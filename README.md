# BMS Balanced
This Kicad repo is reverse engineering of cheap-chinese-cell balanced BMS. This repo is inspired by this [circuitdigest's post](https://circuitdigest.com/electronic-circuits/lithium-ion-battery-management-and-protection-module-bms-teardown-schematics-parts-list-and-working) about reverse engineering the BMS.
